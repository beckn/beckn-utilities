## 13. Certification and Compliance

### Summary
The video discusses various aspects of compliance and certification within API networks, specifically highlighting the different layers of policies that apply. It begins by noting that API compliance can vary based on the specific requirements of networks, such as a teleconsultation network that may not require extensive status updates. The presenter emphasizes how API policies can be categorized into distinctive levels: API level compliance that focuses on fundamental APIs; domain level compliance that pertains to operational specifics like pickup and drop locations; and use-case compliance which might necessitate details like passenger age for flight bookings. The video explains that regional compliance may also play a role in ensuring participants possess the necessary permits to engage with a network.

The speaker introduces the method of compliance verification, mentioning two primary options: offline verification through participant collaboration and the formation of a self-regulatory organization (SRO), or the utilization of certification agencies. The certificate acquisition process is compared to obtaining an SSL certificate, necessitating the creation of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that outlines testing scopes. Compliance testing is performed by a certification body, which then issues a digital certificate if all requirements are met. This certificate facilitates automatic registration with a network's registry and allows platforms to begin transactions seamlessly. The video closes with an example of how certification works, noting that digital certificates can vary in type based on the nature of the request, such as first-time certification or recertification.
