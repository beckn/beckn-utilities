# Release Notes

## ONIX Version 0.1.0 (2024-02-16)

### Objective
ONIX - Open Network In A Box, is a utility designed to effortlessly set up all BECKN components on a machine using a one-click installer. This tool serves as a valuable resource for developers and network participants eager to explore BECKN protocols or join open networks supported by the BECKN protocol. By simplifying the installation process, ONIX streamlines the onboarding experience.

The current version installs all components automatically without requiring user input, facilitating a seamless setup process. However, we are committed to further enhancing ONIX's functionality. In the upcoming release, we will introduce the capability to selectively install specific components and accommodate user-provided configurations.
